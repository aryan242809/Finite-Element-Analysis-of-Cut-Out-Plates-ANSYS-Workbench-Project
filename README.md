# Finite-Element-Analysis-of-Cut-Out-Plates-ANSYS-Workbench-Project
This repository contains the simulation models, screenshots, and results for an engineering assessment involving the finite element analysis (FEA) of a rectangular plate with center cut-outs. The study was conducted using ANSYS Workbench to analyze the equivalent stress and total deformation for three different cut-out designs .
