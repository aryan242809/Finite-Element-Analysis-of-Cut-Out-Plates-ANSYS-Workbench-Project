# Finite-Element-Analysis-of-Cut-Out-Plates-ANSYS-Workbench-Project
This repository contains the simulation models, screenshots, and results for an engineering assessment involving the finite element analysis (FEA) of a rectangular plate with center cut-outs. The study was conducted using ANSYS Workbench to analyze the equivalent stress and total deformation for three different cut-out designs .

📄 Assignment Overview
As part of the assessment, the objective was to:
Develop 3D models of a rectangular plate (2m x 1.5m x 0.2m) with different center cuts.
Apply material properties:
Young’s Modulus = 7×10¹⁰ N/m²
Poisson’s Ratio = 0.3
Set boundary conditions:
Left edge fixed
Right edge subjected to 7×10⁷ N/m² pressure
Mesh with 0.1 m size.
Perform static structural analysis to evaluate:

Total deformation
Equivalent (von Mises) stress
Compare results for all 3 cut-out shapes using bar charts.
